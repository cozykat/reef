  Entity

  Represents a generic component of a system model. Entities are modeled by a name
  and some number of types which describe the entity's role in the system. Entities
  also contain a list of Relationship objects which describe connections/associations
  with other entities in the system.

  Together, entities connected by a certain relationship type form an acyclic directed
  graph. The model must not include cycles (given a start entity, it must not be possible
  to get back to the same entity using the same relationship type and direction).

/*
  Relationship

  Entity relationships have a type ("relationship"), a direction ("descendant_of"), and
  a list of Entity objects the relationship connects to. Because relationships are transitive,
  they also have a distance, or how many edges away the other entities are.

  Point

  Represents a configured input point for data acquisition. Measurements associated with
  this point all use the point name.

  Every Point is associated with an Entity of type "Point". The point's location in the system
  model is determined by this entity. Points are also associated with entities designated as
  "logical nodes", which represent the communications interface/source.

  Command

  Represents a configured output point. CommandAccess and UserCommandRequest services use
  this command name.

  Every Command is associated with an Entity of type "Command". The command's location in the
  system model is determined by this entity. Commands are also associated with entities designated
  as "logical nodes", which represent the communications interface/source.

  ConfigFile

  Contains configuration information for an application (i.e. a protocol implementation). The
  configuration and the application must agree on how to interpret the data, which is treated
  as an opaque byte array by the services.

  ConfigFile objects also contain a reference to the entities they are associated with.

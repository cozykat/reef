/**
 * The reef system is fundamentally constructed using a REST approach. This means the system is modeled using nouns and
 * a common set of 4 verbs GET, PUT, POST, DELETE. This is a very powerful approach and allows us to create simple and
 * robust services and have a relatively simple protocol to make interoperability across a wide range of languages
 * possible. While this model is powerful it can also be confusing to an application developer to determine exactly how
 * to map from a concrete goal ("Get list of Substations") to the noun+verb combination necessary to implement that
 * request (GET Entity type=Substation). In order to reduce the cognitive load on application developers we have
 * provided a suite of interfaces that include requests for most of the common use cases. These interfaces are not
 * exhaustive, and do not attempt to expose all of the functionality available to clients of a service, instead they
 * serve as a starting point and suite of examples to pull from to make more complex requests when necessary.
 *
 * <p>Some applications have to write custom requests to support some use cases. Many very "chatty" sets of requests can
 * be implemented with a single more complex request. We envision application developers extending the interfaces with
 * their own custom functions for their application. To add those custom functions it is best to understand the requests
 * we have provided in reference implementations. This can be done in a few  ways.</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> read the code in XxxxxRequestBuilders and XxxxxServiceImpl classes </li>
 * <li> read the "generated proto request/reply" documents, they show live versions of the proto messages that are sent over the wires </li>
 * <li> read the documentation on the protobuf files (*.proto) </li>
 * </ul>
 * Once a new query has been figured out, the XxxxxService class can be extended to add in the new requests.

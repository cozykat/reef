          Event Configs describe all of the types of "well known" event types in the system. When an event occurs,
          1 of 3 things will occur:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Log:</b>
              The event will be logged to a system file but not stored in the events table. This is
              primarily used when we want to suppress events that are deemed unimportant in this installation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Event:</b>
              The event will be stored in the events table. This will generally be visibile on an HMI
              but usually wouldn't be cause a "push" notification to users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Alarm:</b>
              If an event is configured to have type Alarm it is recorded as an event but an alarm
              notification is also generated. This is usually pushed to the users quickly since a user needs to interact
              with the system to silence and/or acknowledge the alarm.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

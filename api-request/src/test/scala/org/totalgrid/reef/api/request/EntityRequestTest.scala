        <p>
          An Entity represents a generic component of a system model. Entities are modeled by a name
        and some number of types which describe the entity's role in the system. Entities
        also contain a list of Relationship objects which describe connections/associations
        with other entities in the system.
        </p>
        Entity relationships have a type ("relationship"), a direction ("descendant_of"), and
  a list of Entity objects the relationship connects to. Because relationships are transitive,
  they also have a distance, or how many edges away the other entities are.
        <p>
          Together, entities connected by a certain relationship type form an acyclic directed
        graph. The model must not include cycles (given a start entity, it must not be possible
        to get back to the same entity using the same relationship type and direction).
        </p>

/**
 * Communication Endpoints are the "field devices" that reef communicates with using legacy protocols
 * to acquire measurements from the field. Every point and command in the system is associated with
 * at most one endpoint at a time. CommEndpointConfig includes information about the protocol, associated
 * points, associated commands, communication channels, config files.
 * <p/>
 * For protocols that have reef front-end support there is an auxiliary service associated with Endpoints that
 * tracks which front-end each endpoint is assigned to. It also tracks the current state of the legacy protocol
 * connection which is how the protocol adapters tell reef if they are successfully communicating with the field
 * devices. We can also disable (and re-enable) the endpoint connection attempts, this is useful for devices that
 * can only talk with one "master" at a time so we can disable reefs protocol adapters temporarily to allow
 * another master to connect.

/**
 * A service interface for managing and retrieving Alarms. Alarms are special
 * system events that require operator intervention. Each alarm has an
 * associated event object, but not all events are alarms.
 * <p/>
 * In contrast to events, alarms have persistent state. The three principal alarm states are unacknowledged,
 * acknowledged, and removed. The transitions between these states constitute the alarm lifecycle, and
 * manipulation of the states involves user workflow.
 * <p/>
 * Transitions in alarm state may themselves be events, as they are part of the record of user operations.
 * <p/>
 * During the configuration process, the system designer decides what events trigger alarms. The primary consumers of
 * alarms are operators tasked with monitoring the system in real-time and responding to abnormal conditions.

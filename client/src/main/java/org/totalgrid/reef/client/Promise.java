 * A Promise is an asynchronous object that can be returned from API functions as a
 * placeholder for a result that will be ready sometime in the future. It is different
 * from a Future because it is not cancelable and provides a callback that will be
 * executed when the value is set. It is also guaranteed to complete eventually with
 * either the expected result or an exception.
 *
 * A Promise can be used in a totally synchronous manner by calling .await() on all
 * promises immediately. The real power in the promises comes from the use of the .listen()
 * callback; this allows the application to be entirely event driven.

 * including:
 *  - user_id that created an event (based on the posters auth token)
 *  - time when the event occured (actually records when the event service processes the put, if a very specific
 *    time is desired use device_time)
 *  - severity, rendered, alarm fields are all set based on the matching EventConfig record
 *  - id is the Event id, if the returned event doesn't have this field set it means it was logged or dropped

 * Tag for api-enhancer, do not delete: !api-definition!

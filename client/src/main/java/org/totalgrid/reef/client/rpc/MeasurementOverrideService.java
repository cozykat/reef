/**
 * SCADA systems there is the concept of a stopping the measurement stream from field and publishing another value in
 * its place. There are 2 ways this is done, marking a point "Not in Service" (NIS) and "Overriding" the point.
 * <p/>
 * This is usually done for one of two  reasons*  - A field devices is reporting a bad value (wildly oscillating or pinned to 0) and is generating spurious
 * alarms or confusing "advanced apps" that are performing calculations on that value. In this case an operator will
 * override that data to its nominal value.
 * - Training/Testing purposes, when an operator or integrator is testing alarms/UI/apps its often valuable to just
 * be able to quickly override a value and see that the correct behaviors occur.

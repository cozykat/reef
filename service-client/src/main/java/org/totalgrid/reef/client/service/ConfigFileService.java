/**
 * Non-exhaustive API for using the reef Config File service, not all valid permutations are reflected here.
 * Additional functions are expected to be added by clients who extends this interface and add the needed
 * functionality using ConfigFileServiceImpl as a examples of other valid queries. Note that this class is a
 * simple interface so it should be easily mockable in test code. Note also that when are using Lists etc. we
 * are using the java classes instead of scala versions b/c its easier to use java lists in scala than scala
 * lists in java.
 * <p/>
 * Config files are for larger hunks of opaque data for use by external applications. Config files can be
 * used by 0, 1 or many entities. Config files can be searched for by name, id or by entities they are
 * related to. Names must be unique system-wide. Searches can all be filtered by mimeType, which can be
 * helpful is name is unknown.
 *
 * Tag for api-enhancer, do not delete: !api-definition!

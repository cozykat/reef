        The basic RESTful service methods provide a powerful and granular way of accessing the Reef service API. However,
        many common requests can be simplified, both conceptually and in terms of code, by being factored into method calls. The
        Reef service request library provides adapters for <literal>ISession</literal> that expose idiomatic Java
        interfaces for Reef services.
    </para>
    <para>
        The adapters are pure interfaces suitable for use in most application code. Interfaces are defined by
        function (<literal>MeasurementService</literal>,
        <literal>EventService</literal>,
        <literal>EntityService</literal>, ...) but there is also a single "super interface"
        that provides all functions in all of the service interfaces: <literal>AllScadaService</literal>.

        <programlisting language="java"><![CDATA[
// Start with a session, as usual

// Wrap the session in a service request adapter

// Update the data in the ConfigFile

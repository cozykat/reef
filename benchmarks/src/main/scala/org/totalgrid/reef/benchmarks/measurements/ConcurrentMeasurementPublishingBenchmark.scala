/**
 * this benchmark tests how long it takes to publish a total number of measurements to the server.
 *
 * Like any benchmark, the data is artificial and doesn't necessarily reflect real world usage.
 * Caveats:
 * - Evenly distributed measurement publishing across streams, real world streams are likely to be very different with
 *   differing usage patterns depending on usage, time of day, polling rates, etc.
 * - Measurements are all different, no filtering is done, real world streams often have lots of redundant information

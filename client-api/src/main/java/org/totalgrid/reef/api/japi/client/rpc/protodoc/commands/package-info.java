 *   CommandRequest

 *   Commands take two forms: without a value attached and with a value attached. Commands with
 *   value attached are the equivalent of "setpoint" or "analog output" in SCADA systems. "Controls"
 *   or "binary outputs" are modeled in the system as two value-less commands, i.e. one for "high" and
 *   one for "low".

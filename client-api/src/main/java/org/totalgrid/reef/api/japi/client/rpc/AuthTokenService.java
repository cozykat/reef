/**
 * A service for retrieving and deleting authorization tokens needed to access all other Reef services.
 * All requests (except for authorization token requests) require that the agent has acquired an
 * "Auth Token" and is sending it with every request. This auth token contains the user name and
 * all of the permissions available to that user. The token itself is a cryptographically secure string
 * that is an unguessable, unforgettable and must be kept secret by the client. Anyone with access to
 * that token will have the full capabilities of that user until it expires or is revoked. When a user
 * is finished using an auth token it should be deleted to minimize this danger.
 * <p/>
 * Every request to the services needs to have an auth token in the headers. They can be sent with each
 * client request, the Session interface has overloads to attach headers to each request. It is easiest
 * to attach the auth token to the underlying session using the setAuthToken function.
 * <p/>
 * add TODO setAuthToken function on Session

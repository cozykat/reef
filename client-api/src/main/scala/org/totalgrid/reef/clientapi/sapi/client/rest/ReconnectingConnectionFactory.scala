 * should be tolerant to the coming and going to the message broker. A
 * ReconnectingConnectionFactory will automatically try making a connection
 * to the broker until it succeeds and re-attempt the connection if the broker
 * is lost. Losing the connection means all Subscriptions, clients and rpc interfaces
 * are now invalid, see the ConnectionWatcher interface for correct application behavior.

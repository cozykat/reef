/**
 * ApplicationConnectionManager manages the connection state to reef. This is more than just the connection to the broker,
 * it also requires that the server is responding to heartbeats from the application. We are only "fully connected"
 * if we have a valid broker connection, were able to login the application level user, register the application
 * and be successfully making heartbeats. If any of those conditions are not met the rest of the application should
 * treat reef as unreachable.
 *
 * Contract:
 *
 * If we are "fully connected" to reef, getConnection() will return a usable reef Connection.
 * If we are not "fully connected" then we will throw an exception if getConnection is called.
 * User code should use isConnected() to see if getConnection will throw (but they will still need
 * to be ready to catch a ReefConnectionClosedException that may occur from outside our control).
 * If user code needs to perform work if the state changes they should register for updates using
 * addConnectionListener. The callbacks will come on a random Executor pool thread.

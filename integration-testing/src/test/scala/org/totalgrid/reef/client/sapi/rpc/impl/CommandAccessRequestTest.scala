          Represents the "access table" for the system. Access entries have one or two
  modes, "allowed" and "blocked". Commands cannot be issued unless they have an
  "allowed" entry. This "selects" the command for operation by a single user, for
  as long as access is held. "Block" allows selects to be disallowed for commands;
  meaning no users can access/issue the commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple commands can be referenced (by name) in the same access entry. User is
  determined by the request header.

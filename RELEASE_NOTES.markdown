Release Notes
==============

Releases are published to the maven repository at https://repo.totalgrid.org/artifactory/webapp/home.html

Version Numbers are of the format {Major}.{Minor}.{Patch}.

* Major version updates are reserved for major features releases
* Minor version updates imply a significant api or datatype change
* Patch version updates should have little to no api or datatype changes

Version 0.4.7 - April 7, 2012
==============

Security focused release, all core applications now use different agents who have been limited to access only necessary
resources. Resource level security is partially implemented but should not be considered production ready in
this release. See services-authz/README.md for details on current authz features and limitations.

### Major Features:

* Client identifies version of code during login and logs mismatchs with server version
* Added shell commands login:list and login:revoke to see who is logged into the system
* "Core applications" load multiple .cfg files to allow overriding of properties (especially of user name)
* Added a suite of standard users and roles for the core applications
* All applications run as minimally privileged agents
* Liquibase database generation switched to default on. reef:resetdb is no longer destructive
* agent-permissions:filter shell command allows viewing which resources a role will have access to.
* Reworked display of agent:* and agent-permissions:* shell commands to be readable.
* Distributions have better licensing and include READMEs and RELEASE_NOTES

### Service/API Updates:

* CommandLocks are never deleted, just marked as "inactive", provides audit log
* Added client_version and server_version fields to SimpleAuth
* Added revoked and issue_time to AuthToken objects
* Applications can register their application version number and belong to multiple networks
* Dnp3 slave can configure output types and scale outputs and control inputs for fixed point systems

### Reef Internals:

* Changed handling of test .cfg files (see cfg-templates/README.md)
* Split up integration tests into function oriented files.
* Config file loading expects many files and silently ignores missing files
* Subscription ids don't include double quotes in the strings
* Services bundle won't start if the database schema is not uptodate

Version 0.4.6 - March 8, 2012
==============

Release is focused on the new calculator protocol and some minor bug fixes.

### Major Features:

* Initial implementation of "calculator" protocol (see /calculator/README.markdown)
* jQuery client files are now served at /jquery-libs/reef.client.js and /jquery-libs/reef.client.core-services.js

### Service/API Updates:

* EntityEdges are available through EntityService (and edges got distance field).

### Bug Fixes:

* sim:config command can select individual endpoints again
* fixed accidental logouts with multiple protocols sharing an FEP

Version 0.4.5 - February 21, 2012
==============

This focus is primarily related to the http-bridge and jQuery client.

### Major Features:

* Implemented jQuery based client that handles most of the AllScadaService calls including limited
  subscription support. (74 of 179)
* It is now possible to implement a service in java (before it required scala)

Version 0.4.4 - February 10, 2012
==============

This release was focused on bug fixes, stability and most importantly performance. This release contains some
large changes to measurement throughput and application startup but may possibly have introduced new issues.
Applications are encouraged to take advantage of the ConnectedApplication and ApplicationConnectionManager classes
to make their applications more error tolerant.

(Requires resetdb on server after upgrade.)

### Major Features:

* Added support for liquibase for schema generation and migration (not enabled by default)
* Metrics service now exposes service for remotely retrieving metrics (now supported in CLI)
* Reworked how applications register and maintain connection to server. If heartbeats fail they will automatically restart.
* Implemented an ApplicationConnectionManager that provides an easy way to write applications that want to know if reef goes down.

### Service/API Updates:

* Added batch gets commands to Command, Point, Endpoint and Entity services (getXbyNames)
* Better error messages on login/logout, timeout and qpid errors.
* reef:resetdb uses password from o.t.r.user.cfg file by default
* added get/findApplicationByName/Uuid functions to ApplicationService

### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed accidental synchronization in measurement processor that was effectively making it single threaded.
* MixedMeasurementStores write to the multiple stores in parallel.
* Heartbeat service ignores time sent to it by clients (clock mismatch caused apps to be marked offline)
* reef:unload uses batchsize of 1 by default (avoids timeouts while deleting points with many measurements)
* When an endpoint goes offline a measurement message is published
* Mitigated "spammed auth" issues by indexing table, moving event generation to another thread,

### Reef Internals:

* Entities Atttributes are now are correctly eventted (and subscribable)
* Added more benchmark tests and made benchmark tests externally configurable.
* Bundles all publish correct version number in OSGi
* Database connections are now explict (no more SessionFactory singleton)
* MeasurementStores are now published to OSGi using factory class MeasurementStoreProvider

### Upstream project versions

==============

### Major Features:

* Added getMeasurementHistoryByName overloads
* Deprecated PointService.getPointsOwnedByEntity(Entity) in favor of passing in ReefUUID, will be removed in 0.5.x

### Bug Fixes:

* Entity types are sorted by string now (order was undefined but usually insertion order before)
* Current Measurement value requests are returned in order they are requested (order was undefined)
* Database connection pools size is now configurable

* Factored version numbers into parent pom file
* Implemented StandaloneNode for use in standalone tests
* Removed "recorded proto documentation" from integration tests

### Upstream project versions

Version 0.4.2  - January 4, 2012
==============

Bugfix and stability release. (Requires resetdb on server after upgrade.)

### Service/API Updates:

* Added EntityService.getEntityRelationsForParents command to a "wide request" in a single request

### Breaking Changes:

* CommandService.bindCommandHandler returns SubscriptionBinding instead of Cancelable

### Bug Fixes:

### Upstream project versions

* Executor4s : 0.1.9 - upgraded to get exceptions on deadlocks

Version 0.4.1 - December 20, 2011
==============

Update focused on stability improvements and command service updates. It is recommend that all applications
update to get important threading related bug fixes. This upgrade is considered very-low risk, the main change
that may affect applications is the order of returned results has been made explicit which might affect tests
that assume a particular result will be first/last. Before this version the result order was loosely based on
insertion order.

### Major Features:

* Command requests can carry a String value REEF-199
* Command results can include an error string REEF-200
* New RestOperations service level API to implement custom REST queries

* CommandService.executeCommand* functions return CommandResult instead of CommandStatus. CommandResult includes
  command status (.getStatus) and error string (.getErrorMessage) for non-successful commands.
* Added missing "throws ReefServiceException" on EventService.getRecentEvents
* Database schema has changed requiring a "reef:resetdb" (Server side)

### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed await() deadlock inside subscription callback

* Remote CLI correctly handles broker disconnect events. REEF-195

### Reef Internals:

Version 0.4.0 - December 7, 2011
==============

Major refactoring of communication client and threading structure. See MIGRATION_STEPS.markdown
